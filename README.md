# Course Registration

This is a course selling website, created by me. All the requirements in our assignment have been fulfilled. Since I'm a beginner, and projecting with fast time react, I had to think a lot to meet the requirements. I broke down each requirement into small steps.
Then I started converting my thoughts into programming one by one. I have encountered many errors while coding, when an error occurs I notice the error well and identify where the error is coming from. After finding out where the error is coming from I fix the error. Since this was my first React project
, so I was a bit nervous about it. But I was confident that I could do it. Then when I start coding, I go through each step one by one. Finally my assignment seven project is complete.
